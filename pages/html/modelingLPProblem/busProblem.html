<h1>Bus drivers scheduling problem</h1>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-7">
    <p>Consider a bus company scheduling drivers for its buses each day, as illustrated in Table 1 (the first	<b>known</b> of the problem). We want it to fulfill it completely. Drivers work 8 hour shifts that start at times: 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 or 20. The drivers are paid a fix rate (RT) per 8 hours (second <b>known</b> of the problem).</p>

<p class="lead">Identify the unknowns (identify the decision variables)</p>
<p>The decision variable is the number of drivers allocated every 4 hours.</br>
  X0, X4, X8, X12, X16, X20.</br>
  Mathematical notation: Xi, i={0, 4, 8,.. 20}</br>
</p>
<p class="lead">Formal expression including the unknowns (identify the objective function)</p>
<p>The objective function is the cost of paying all the bus drivers for a day. In this case we want to minimize the cost.</br>
  C(ost) = X0*RT + X4*RT + X8*RT+ ...</br>
  Mathematical form: C(ost) = sum(Xi*RT); i = {0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20}</br>
</p>
<p class="lead">Business limitations imposed on the unknowns (identify the constraints)</p>
<p>The constraints ensure that the drivers allocated for each interval cover the requirement for buses for it.</br>
  X20+X0 >= R0; X0+X4 >= R4; X4+X8 >= R8; ...; where Ri is the required number of buses for the interval starting at hour i and ending at hour i+4</br>
</p>
<p class="lead">Practical limitations imposed on the unknowns (identify the non-negativity constraints)</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-7">
    <p>The non-negativity constraints ensure the number if allocated drivers for an interval is not negative.</br>
      X0 >= 0, X4 >= 0, X8 >= 0, X12 >= 0, X16 >= 0, X20 >= 0</br>
      </br>
      The optimal solution (Table 2) is X0=4; X4=10; X8=0; X12=8; X16=4; X20=0.</br>
