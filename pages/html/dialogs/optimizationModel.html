<h1>Optimization model</h1>
<p>A mathematical model that contains a criterion or objective, which we seek to optimize (e.g. maximize or minimize), subject to a set of mathematical constraints that portray the conditions under which the decisions have to be made. Optimization models are used in Operations research which will be defined later.</p>
