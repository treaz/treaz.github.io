<h1>Constraints</h1>
<p class="lead">Description</p>
<p>An inequality (e.g. a>b, a>=b) or equality (e.g. a=b) defining limitations on decision variables.</p>
<p class="lead">Example (from the bus scheduling problem)</p>
<ul>
  <li>The constraints ensure that the drivers allocated for each interval cover the requirement for buses for it: X20+X0 >= R0; X0+X4 >= R4; X4+X8 >= R8; ...; where Ri is the required number of buses for the interval starting at hour i and ending at hour i+4</li>
</ul>
