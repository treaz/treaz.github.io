<h1>Objective function</h1>
<p class="lead">Description</p>
<p>A function that consists of decision variables that needs to be maximized or minimized which specifies the criterion the decision maker will use to evaluate alternative solutions to the problem.</p>
<p class="lead">Example (from the bus scheduling problem)</p>
<ul>
  <li>The objective function is the cost of paying all the bus drivers for a day: C(ost) = X0*RT + X4*RT + X8*RT+ ... In this case we want to minimize the cost.</li>
  <li>Mathematical notation: C(ost) = sum(Xi*RT); i = {0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20}</li>
</ul>
