<h1>Feasible region</h1>
<p class="lead">Description</p>
<p>
  Region bounded by the lines corresponding to the constraints (where all the feasible solutions of the model lie). A constraint line separates any plane into a feasible plane and an unfeasible plane.<br>
  <br>
  Below you can see the feasible region determined by the constraints of the current model.<br>
  All the values (X_plain, X_mexican) found in this region are feasible solutions.<br>
