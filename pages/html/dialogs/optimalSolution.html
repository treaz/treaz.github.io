<h1>Solution/optimal solution</h1>
<p class="lead">Solution description</p>
<p>A proposal of specific values for the decision variables.</br>
  </br>
  A problem can be:</br>
  <ul>
   <li>feasible: if it has at least one solution that satisfies all the constraints</li>
   <li>infeasible: if no solutions can be found that satisfy all the constraints</li>
  </ul>
 </p>
<p class="lead">Optimal solution description</p>
<p>A feasible solution that yields the best value (maximum or minimum) of the objective function. The optimal solution is usually calculated automatically by a computer.</p>
